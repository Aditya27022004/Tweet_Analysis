# sentiment_analysis
Developed a sentiment analysis project that involved extracting, processing, and analyzing tweets to classify their sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). Utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to preprocess text data, remove noise, and train a classifier. Implemented Python libraries such as NLTK, TextBlob, or Hugging Face Transformers for sentiment scoring and visualization tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn to present insights effectively.
